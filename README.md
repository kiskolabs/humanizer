# Humanizer

Humanizer is a very simple CAPTCHA method. It has a localized YAML file with questions and answers which is used to validate that the user is an actual human. Any model that includes ActiveModel::Validations should work. Our aim is to be database and mapper agnostic, so if it doesn't work for you, open an issue. Humanizer only works with Rails 3.

## Installation

1. `gem install humanizer`
2. `rails g humanizer`

## Advanced Installation

* Install all locales: `rails g humanizer --all-locales`
* Show available locales: `rails g humanizer --show-locales`
* Install selected locales: `rails g humanizer en fi de`

## Usage in Simple Form

1. In your model, include Humanizer and add the #require_human_on method, example:

        class User < ActiveRecord::Base
          include Humanizer
          require_human_on :create
        end

2. Ask the question in the form, example:

        <%= f.label :humanizer_answer, @model.humanizer_question %>
        <%= f.text_field :humanizer_answer %>
        <%= f.hidden_field :humanizer_question_id %>

3. If you are using attr_accessible, remember to whitelist `:humanizer_answer` and `:humanizer_question_id`.

## Usage in Nested Model Form (Post has many Comments)

1. In your Comment model, include Humanizer and add the #require_human_on method:

          class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
            belongs_to :post
            include Humanizer
            require_human_on :create
          end

2. In your Post model, define the relationship:

          class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
            has_many :comments 
            accepts_nested_attributes_for :comments
          end

3. In your posts_controller.rb file, add a new comment under the 'show' action:

           def show
           . . .
           @comment = Comment.new

4. In your comments_controller.rb file, for the 'create' action, edit your @comment assignment, and add a @post assignment:

           def create
           @post = Post.find(params[:post_id])
           @comment = @post.comments.create(params[:comment])

4. Ask the question in the form (/views/posts/show.html.erb for example):

           <%= form_for [@post, @comment] do |f| %>
           . . . 
           <%= f.label :humanizer_answer, @comment.humanizer_question %>
           <%= f.text_field :humanizer_answer %>
           <%= f.hidden_field :humanizer_question_id %>

## Configuration

Default translations can be found in config/locales/

You might want to add/change question and answer pairs. This can be easily done by adding/modifying entries in locales file.

## Skipping validation

You might want to skip the humanizer validations on your tests or rails console.

You can just have a simple attribute on your model and use it to bypass the validation. Here's an example:

    attr_accessor :bypass_humanizer
    require_human_on :create, :unless => :bypass_humanizer

Now when bypass_humanizer is true, validation will be skipped.

## Reloading questions

In case you want to give your users the option to change the question, there's a #change_humanizer_question method to help you.

To make sure the current question doesn't get asked again, you can pass the current question id to the method. For example:

    @user.change_humanizer_question(params[:user][:humanizer_question_id])
